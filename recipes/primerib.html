        <p>Prime ribs have always been a staple dish for the holidays. I much prefer it over turkey. I've found that the best method I've used was the reverse sear method popularized by Food Lab</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Prime Rib, preferably good quality or dry aged</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Season prime rib with salt and pepper at least the day before (up to 4 days before)</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 150 degrees F and place prime rib in oven for 6 hours (or 250 degrees for 3 hours)</li>
            <li>When prime rib reaches internal temperature of 125-130, remove from oven and cover with foil for 30 minutes up to an hour and half</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, turn up oven to 500-550 degrees F and place prime rib in oven for 5-15 minutes</li>
        </ol>
